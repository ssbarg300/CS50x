If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I would have calculated using loudness and tempo of the song, as slow tracks usally have low loudness and tempo compared to rap tracks.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
This might not be the best way to calculate because songs can have varying attritubes, maybe look at what an artist is mostly popular for ?
